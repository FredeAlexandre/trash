# Getting Started

Let's introduce you to the basics concepts of _{{project.name}}_

## IMA background

1. Federated Hardware

In the first aircrafts the functions installed was shipped with their own hardware. Meaning the same team/company that developed the software also developed the hardware. This was as advantage to have a full control and ensure the software was running on the right hardware. But the issues was on the cost to produce the hardware and time to replace a hardware if it was damaged. 1 function = 1 hardware = 1 architecture.

2. Modular Hardware

After the federated hardware, the modular hardware was introduced. This means that all functions are installed on their own hardware but the hardware is not dedicated to a function. So we can use the same hardware for different functions. This was a big improvement in terms of cost and time to replace a hardware. 1 function = 1 hardware = n architecture.

3. Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA)

The IMA is the next step after the modular hardware. The IMA is a concept that allows to run different functions on the same hardware. This means that we can have a single hardware running different functions. This is a big improvement in terms of cost and time to replace a hardware. n function = 1 hardware = 1 architecture.

Now the challenge resides on the communication between the different actors of the IMA Module.
