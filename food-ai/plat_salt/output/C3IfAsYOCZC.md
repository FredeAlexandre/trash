 # Korean Fried Chicken (Air Fryer)

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs (1 kg) chicken wings or drumsticks
- Cornflakes, enough to coat the chicken pieces
- Oil for frying and coating the cornflakes

### For the Sauce:
- 1/3 cup gochujang sauce
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp corn syrup (optional)
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp sriracha (optional)
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- Sesame seeds for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400째F (205째C). If using an oven or deep fryer, follow the instructions in your recipe.

2. In a large bowl, mix together gochujang sauce, soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and corn syrup (if using). Stir in minced garlic, ginger, sugar, and sriracha (if desired). Set aside.

3. Coat each chicken piece in cornflakes, ensuring they are evenly coated. Shake off excess cornflakes and set aside.

4. In a large skillet or pan over medium heat, add oil enough to coat the bottom. Add cornflakes and toast them until golden brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool before crushing into smaller pieces.

5. Brush each chicken piece with oil and place them in a single layer inside the air fryer basket. Cook for about 12-15 minutes or until they reach an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C). Shake the basket halfway through to ensure even cooking.

6. In a large bowl, toss cooked chicken pieces with the sauce until well coated. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds before serving.

## Notes

- For extra spiciness, add more sriracha or gochujang sauce to the sauce mixture.
- To make this recipe vegan, use plant-based chicken alternatives and substitute honey with agave nectar or maple syrup.
