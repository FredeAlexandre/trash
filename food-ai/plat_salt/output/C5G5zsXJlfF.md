 # Butterfly Korean Honey Fried Chicken

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs (1 kg) chicken wings, tips removed and cut in half if large
- 1 cup (235 ml) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (118 ml) cornstarch
- Salt to taste
- 1 tsp (5 g) black pepper, freshly ground
- 4 cups (946 ml) vegetable oil for frying

### For the Marinade:

- 1/2 cup (118 ml) soy sauce
- 1/3 cup (78 ml) honey
- 1/4 cup (59 ml) gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 2 tbsp (30 g) minced garlic
- 1 tbsp (15 g) grated ginger
- 1 tbsp (15 g) rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp (15 g) sesame oil
- 1 tbsp (15 g) corn syrup
- 2 tbsp (30 g) brown sugar
- 1 tbsp (15 g) fish sauce
- 1 tbsp (15 g) Sriracha or other chili sauce (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, prepare the marinade by combining soy sauce, honey, gochujang, garlic, ginger, rice vinegar, sesame oil, corn syrup, brown sugar, fish sauce, and Sriracha or other chili sauce (optional). Whisk until well combined.
2. Add chicken wings to the marinade, ensuring they are fully coated. Marinate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight, in the refrigerator.
3. In a large bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, salt, and black pepper.
4. Remove chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Coat each piece in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Set aside on a plate or baking sheet.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350째F (177째C).
6. Fry chicken wings in batches for 8 minutes, or until they begin to turn golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer each batch to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet to drain excess oil.
7. Once all the chicken is fried, increase oil temperature to 375째F (190째C). Carefully place the chicken back into the oil and cook for an additional 4 minutes, until they reach a deep golden brown color. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
8. Serve hot with steamed rice or lettuce wraps. Enjoy!

## Notes

- For a spicier version, increase the amount of gochujang or add more chili sauce to the marinade.
- To make this recipe gluten-free, use cornstarch instead of flour for coating the chicken.
