 # Honey Chipotle Chicken Snack Wraps

## Ingredients

- **Chicken Marinade (for 8 tenders)**
  - 1.5 lb (680g) chicken breast tenders
  - 1/4 cup (60ml) egg whites
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
- **Breading (for 8 tenders)**
  - 64g (2.3 oz) cheese protein chips (Quest, Atkins, etc.)
  - 42g (1.5 oz) corn flakes
  - 1/4 cup (60g) flour
  - 1 tbsp baking powder
- **Honey Chipotle Glaze**
  - 2 tbsp honey
  - 2 tbsp chipotle adobo sauce
  - (Optional for extra spiciness) 1-2 chipotle adobo peppers, blended in
- **Wrap Assembly**
  - 1 chicken tender (~3 oz / 85g)
  - 1 Mission low carb tortilla
  - 14g reduced fat Colby jack cheese
  - 1 tbsp homemade honey chipotle ranch
  - Lettuce

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Chicken Marinade:** In a large bowl, combine chicken tenders, egg whites, salt, paprika, and garlic powder. Mix well and let marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
2. **Prepare Breading:** Crush corn flakes and cheese protein chips separately into fine crumbs. Combine flour, baking powder, crushed cornflakes, and crushed cheese protein chips in a shallow dish.
3. **Fry Chicken:** Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chicken from marinade and coat each piece with breading mixture. Place coated chicken tenders in the air fryer basket, being careful not to overcrowd. Cook for 12-16 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165¬∞F (74¬∞C), flipping halfway through. Repeat this process for all chicken tenders.
4. **Prepare Honey Chipotle Glaze:** In a small saucepan, combine honey and chipotle adobo sauce over medium heat. Cook until slightly thickened. Optionally, blend in 1-2 chipotle adobo peppers for added spiciness.
5. **Assemble Wrap:** Place a cooked chicken tender on a Mission low carb tortilla. Top with reduced fat Colby jack cheese, a tablespoon of homemade honey chipotle ranch, and lettuce. Drizzle with honey chipotle glaze before rolling up the wrap.

## Notes

- Feel free to customize the amount of heat in the honey chipotle glaze by adjusting the number of chipotle adobo peppers used.
- For best results, allow chicken tenders to rest for a few minutes after cooking before assembling wraps.
