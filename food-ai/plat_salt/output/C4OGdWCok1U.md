 # Triple Bluebby Burger üçîüëë

## Ingredients

- 3 patties, ground beef
- 3 buns
- 1.5 cups blue cheese, crumbled
- 6 slices of cooked bacon
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 lettuce leaves
- 6 slices of tomato
- 12 onion rings
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the ground beef with salt and pepper, forming patties to fit the buns. Cook for about 4 minutes per side, or until desired doneness. Set aside on plates and keep warm.
2. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard; set aside as the special sauce.
3. Fry the onion rings in hot oil until golden brown, then place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.
4. Toast the buns if desired.
5. Build each burger by spreading a generous amount of the special sauce on both sides of the top and bottom bun, followed by a patty, blue cheese, cooked bacon, lettuce, tomato slice, additional blue cheese, and fried onion rings. Top with the remaining bun half.
6. Serve immediately and enjoy!

## Notes

- For a spicier version, add a few dashes of hot sauce to the special sauce mixture.
- This burger is best served with extra napkins!
