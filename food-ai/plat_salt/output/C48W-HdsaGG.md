 # Chicken Caramelized Like at the Restaurant âœ¨

## Ingredients
- 400 g of chicken fillets (about 1 lb)
- 160 g of rice (about 0.5 lb)
- 5 tbsp flour
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp sugar
- Oil for frying
- Chives
- Ice cubes
- Sesame seeds

## Instructions
1. Cut the chicken into pieces. Mix with flour, 2 tbsp sugar and ice cubes. Heat oil for frying. Cautiously add the chicken once hot, cook until golden brown and lightly coated.
2. Remove the chicken from the pan onto absorbent paper to drain excess oil. In a saucepan, heat soy sauce and remaining sugar until syrupy. Add cooked chicken, stir, add sesame seeds and serve over rice and chives.

## Notes
- Use ice cubes instead of water for an extra crunch in the coating.
- Adjust amount of sugar according to desired sweetness level.
