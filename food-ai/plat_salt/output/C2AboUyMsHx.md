 # Chicken Fried in Korean Style (Poulet Frit Cor√©en)

## Ingredients

- 4 pieces chicken breasts, boneless and skinless
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. In a shallow dish, mix together flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
2. Dip each chicken breast in buttermilk, making sure it is fully coated.
3. Coat the buttermilk-covered chicken in the flour mixture.
4. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven filled with vegetable oil over medium heat to 350¬∞F (176¬∞C).
5. Carefully place the floured and buttermilk-coated chicken breasts into the hot oil and fry for about 8 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown.
6. Remove the chicken from the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
7. Serve the chicken warm with your preferred dipping sauce or side dishes.

## Notes

- For a spicier version, add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.
- Serve this dish with steamed rice, kimchi, and Korean chili paste for an authentic experience.
