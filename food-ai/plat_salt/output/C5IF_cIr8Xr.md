 # Loaded Potato Recipe - A Viral Hit from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾

## Ingredients

- 4 large potatoes, scrubbed clean
- Salt, to taste
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions
- 1/4 cup salsa
- 1/4 cup jalapeÃ±o peppers, sliced (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F (205Â°C). Prick potatoes with a fork several times and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes or until tender.
2. Cut each potato in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving a thin layer around the skin for support.
3. Season the hollowed-out potato skins with salt. Return the skins to the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
4. In a small bowl, combine sour cream with a pinch of salt, if desired.
5. Top each loaded potato skin with a dollop of sour cream.
6. Sprinkle shredded cheese evenly over the sour cream.
7. Add bacon crumbles, green onions, salsa, and jalapeÃ±o peppers (optional) to each potato.
8. Return the loaded potatoes to the oven under the broiler until the cheese is melted and slightly golden brown, approximately 2 minutes.
9. Serve immediately and enjoy!

## Notes

- For a spicier version, use hot salsa instead of mild.
- For a vegetarian option, omit the bacon.
