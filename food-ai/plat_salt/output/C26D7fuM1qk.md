 # Honey Sriracha Salmon Bites

## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless salmon (3 servings)
- 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons sriracha
- (optional) 2 cloves minced garlic

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Cut the salmon into bite-sized pieces and place them in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat evenly.
3. In a small bowl, mix together salt, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper. Sprinkle this seasoning blend over the salmon and toss gently to ensure all pieces are coated.
4. In another small bowl, whisk together honey and sriracha (and minced garlic if using). Set aside.
5. Place the seasoned salmon in the air fryer basket, ensuring they do not touch each other. Air fry for 6 minutes.
6. Brush or drizzle the honey sriracha glaze over the salmon bites.
7. Return the salmon to the air fryer and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until glazed and crispy.

## Notes

- For optimal results, use a high-quality olive oil and natural honey for this recipe.
- The optional minced garlic adds extra flavor and can be omitted if preferred.
