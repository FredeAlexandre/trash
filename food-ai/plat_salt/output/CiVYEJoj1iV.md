 # Chicken Fried Rice

## Ingredients

- 2 cups cooked rice (preferably a day old)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into small pieces
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup sliced bell pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup cooked peas and carrots
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 3 tablespoons rice wine
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until browned and set aside.
2. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and sauté onions until softened. Add bell pepper and cook until tender. Remove from pan and set aside with chicken.
3. Using the remaining oil, sauté garlic until fragrant. Add rice to the pan and stir well to coat with oil.
4. Push rice to one side of the pan. Pour beaten eggs into the other side and scramble them. Once cooked, mix with rice.
5. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, and rice wine. Pour over rice and stir well to coat.
6. Add cooked vegetables and chicken back into the pan. Stir gently until heated through.
7. Season with salt if needed.
8. Transfer fried rice to serving dish and garnish with green onions.

## Notes

- Cooked rice is preferable a day old for best results as it will not turn mushy when frying.
- Adjust the amount of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and rice wine to suit your taste preference.
