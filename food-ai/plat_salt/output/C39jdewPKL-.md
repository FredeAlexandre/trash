 # Pork Katsu Bento

## Ingredients

- 150g pork fillet, cut into fillets
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup flour
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Vegetable oil for frying
- 1 cucumber
- 3 rice cups cooked rice
- 2 sheets nori (seaweed)
- Soy sauce and wasabi for serving
- 2 tbsp tonkatsu sauce

## Instructions

1. Prepare the pork katsu: Dip each pork fillet in flour, then egg, and finally coat with panko breadcrumbs. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the pork katsu until golden brown on both sides. Drain excess oil on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Prepare tamagoyaki (Japanese rolled omelette): Whisk eggs, add salt and pour into a square or rectangular shaped pan, spreading evenly. As the egg begins to set around the edges, roll it up using a bamboo mat and continue cooking until all pieces are cooked through. Repeat for remaining eggs.
4. Slice cucumber diagonally and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and set aside.
5. Assemble bento box: Place rice at the bottom of each compartment, followed by a piece of nori, pork katsu, tamagoyaki, and cucumber slices.
6. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi for dipping. Drizzle tonkatsu sauce over pork katsu.

## Notes

- For an authentic taste, use tonkatsu sauce instead of BBQ sauce or ketchup.
- To make the box look more visually appealing, consider cutting the pork katsu into bite-sized pieces and arranging them in a fan shape.
