 # Crunchy Chicken Cheese Balls

## Ingredients

For chicken marinade:

- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken, cut into large square cubes
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese, cubed
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp cajun seasoning
- 1 tbsp paprika powder
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder

For the batter:

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup corn starch
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 egg
- Salt to taste
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup corn flakes, crushed into small pieces

## Instructions

1. Make a small slit in the center of each chicken cube using a knife. Stuff each cube with a cheese cube.
2. Season the stuffed chicken with salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, paprika powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, add all-purpose flour, corn starch, salt, pepper, egg, and water. Whisk until a thick batter forms.
4. In a separate dish, add crushed corn flakes.
5. Coat each seasoned chicken in the wet batter, then evenly coat with the corn flakes.
6. Heat oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Once hot, carefully drop the coated chicken balls into the oil (don't overcrowd the pan). Cook for 15-20 minutes or until crispy and golden brown.

## Notes

- For best results, ensure that the oil temperature remains consistent throughout the frying process.
- Allow the chicken balls to cool slightly before serving to prevent the cheese from oozing out too much.
