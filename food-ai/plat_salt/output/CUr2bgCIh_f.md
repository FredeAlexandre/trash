 # McDonald's Chicken Nuggets Recipe

## Ingredients

- 500 gr (1.1 lb) of chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
- Salt and pepper
- 200 gr (2 cups) of all-purpose flour
- 80 gr (1 cup) of cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon of paprika
- 1 teaspoon of ginger
- 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 4 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 glass of cold water
- Oil for deep frying (e.g., canola oil)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the coating: In a bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, paprika, ginger, brown sugar, salt, and pepper.
2. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, soy sauce, and cold water.
3. Coat each chicken piece in the egg mixture, then roll it in the flour mixture to fully coat. Repeat this process for all chicken pieces.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (176°C). Fry the coated chicken pieces until golden brown, approximately 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

## Notes

- For best results, do not overcrowd the fryer when cooking the nuggets. Fry them in batches if necessary.
- Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.
