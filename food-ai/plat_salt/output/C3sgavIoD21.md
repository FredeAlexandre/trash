 # Sweet Chilli Chicken Tenders

## Ingredients
- 400g Chicken breast, cut into thick strips
- 1/2 tbsp Chicken seasoning
- 1 tsp Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Garlic granules

For dredging-:
- Corn flakes, crushed
- 1 egg, beaten - add 1 tsp hot sauce

For the glaze -:
- 80g Sweet Chilli sauce
- 1 tbsp Light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Warm water
- 1/4 tsp Sesame oil

## Instructions
1. In a bowl, add the chicken strips and mix in all of the seasonings, coating them well.
2. Take a strip, dip it in the egg mixture (beaten egg with hot sauce), then coat it in the crushed cornflakes, patting them in well. Set aside. Repeat this process with the remaining chicken strips.
3. Preheat your air fryer to 190Â°C and spray the tray with a little cooking oil. Place the chicken tenders in a single layer. Cook for 16 minutes, turning halfway through.
4. Once the cooking cycle is done, check that the chicken is cooked through and remove it from the air fryer. Dip the chicken tenders in the sauce or glaze with a brush and serve immediately!

## Notes
- You can adjust the amount of hot sauce according to your preference.
- For a spicier version, add more chilli flakes to the cornflake coating.
