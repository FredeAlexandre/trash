 # Poutine at Home

## Ingredients

- 1 lb russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- Salt
- 1 lb ground beef or Italian sausage, cooked and drained
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 lb frozen French fries
- 1 1/2 cups brown gravy
- 1 1/2 cups sour cream
- 4 green onions, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F (205Â°C). Toss potatoes with oil and spread evenly on a baking sheet; season with salt. Bake until tender and golden, about 30 minutes.

2. In a large saucepan, cook ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat. Remove from pan; set aside. Drain off all but 1 tbsp of the drippings.

3. In the same pan, cook onion until softened. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in flour until it forms a paste. Gradually whisk in milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1 cup cheddar cheese until melted.

4. In a large bowl, toss French fries with a small amount of gravy and sour cream. Transfer to a baking sheet. Top with cooked meat, then cover with the remaining gravy. Sprinkle with remaining cheeses.

5. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve immediately, garnished with green onions.

## Notes

- For a vegetarian option, use vegetarian ground meat substitute or omit the meat.
- Toppings such as bacon bits, jalapenos or other vegetables can be added to taste.
