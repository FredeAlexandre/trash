 # Kimchi Fried Rice

## Ingredients

- 2 cups cooked rice, preferably left over and chilled
- 1 cup kimchi, drained and chopped
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 small carrot, peeled and diced
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce (or to taste)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- Salt, to taste
- Optional garnishes: pickled radish, kimchi, sesame seeds, fried egg

## Instructions

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it!
3. Add the carrot and cook for 3-4 minutes, until slightly softened.
4. Stir in the rice and kimchi, breaking up any large clumps of rice. Cook for about 3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
5. Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice. Add salt to taste if needed.
6. Stir in the green onions and cook for an additional minute or two.
7. Serve the kimchi fried rice in bowls, garnished with optional toppings such as pickled radish, kimchi, sesame seeds, or a fried egg. Enjoy!

## Notes

- For an extra protein boost, consider adding cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu.
- Kimchi can vary greatly in spiciness, so adjust the amount added accordingly.
- If desired, add other vegetables such as bell peppers, zucchini, or snap peas for added texture and flavor.
