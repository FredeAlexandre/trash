 # Alfredo Chicken Lasagna Rolls

## Ingredients

- 3-4 chicken breasts
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp Dan O original
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- Shredded mozzarella
- 6-8 lasagna sheets

### Alfredo Sauce Ingredients

- 4-5 cloves minced garlic
- 4 oz cream cheese (room temperature)
- 2 1/2 tbsp unsalted chicken stock/broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup pasta water
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook the lasagna sheets until al dente and preserve the pasta water.
2. Prepare the chicken by cutting into small cubes and add oil, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, Dan O, garlic powder, and oregano. Cook the chicken in a pan (make sure not to crowd it).
3. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F (204Â°C).
4. In the same pan as the chicken, add the minced garlic and cream cheese. Mix the cream cheese until it melts, then deglaze with chicken stock. Add in heavy cream, paprika, and oregano. Once the sauce starts to simmer, mix in the shredded Parmesan cheese. Add pasta water as needed.
5. Assemble the rolls by layering sauce, shredded mozzarella, and shredded chicken. Roll tightly and place in a baking dish. Cover with the remaining Alfredo sauce and sprinkle with more mozzarella.
6. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 15-20 minutes. At the last minute remove aluminum and broil the cheese.
