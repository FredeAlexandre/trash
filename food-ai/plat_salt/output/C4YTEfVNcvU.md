 # Chicken Fingers by Nadine Moll

## Ingredients

- 500g (1.1 lbs) Chicken Breast Fillet
- 350ml (1 1/2 cups) Buttermilch
- 3 EL (3 tbsp) Mehl (All-purpose flour)
- 2 TL (2 tsp) Salt
- 1 TL (1 tbsp) Paprika
- 1 TL (1 tbsp) Curry
- 2 TL (2 tbsp) Chicken Spice
- 200g (7 oz) Cornflakes
- Oil for frying

## Ingredients for Dip

- 100g (3.5 oz) Mayonnaise
- 2 EL (2 tbsp) Sriracha Sauce (Chili sauce)

## Instructions

1. Cut the Chicken Breast Fillet into long pieces.
2. In a bowl, whisk together Buttermilch, 3 tablespoons Mehl, 2 teaspoons Salt, 1 tablespoon Paprika, 1 tablespoon Curry, and 2 tablespoons Chicken Spice (reserve 1 tablespoon Chicken Spice for Cornflakes).
3. In a food processor or blender, crush the Cornflakes. In a separate shallow dish, mix crushed Cornflakes with the reserved 1 tablespoon Chicken Spice.
4. Dip each chicken piece first in the buttermilch mixture, then coat it evenly with the cornflake mixture, pressing gently to adhere.
5. Heat oil in a pan and fry the chicken pieces in batches for about 2 minutes on each side at medium heat until golden brown.
6. In a small bowl, mix together Mayonnaise and Sriracha Sauce.
7. Serve Chicken Fingers with the dipping sauce.

## Notes

- For an extra spicy version, increase the amount of Sriracha Sauce in the dip.
- The Chicken Fingers can be served with your favorite BBQ or ketchup sauce instead of the provided dip.
