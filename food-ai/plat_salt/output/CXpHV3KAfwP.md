 # Pringle-Coated Fried Chicken

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs (1.8 kg) chicken pieces
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups (475 ml) buttermilk
- 3 cups (700 g) all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 tsp (5 ml) smoked paprika
- 1 tsp (5 ml) garlic powder
- 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder
- 1 tsp (5 ml) cayenne pepper (optional)
- 2 cups (475 g) crushed Pringles
- 3 cups (700 ml) vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. Rinse chicken pieces under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Place the buttermilk in a large bowl or baking dish, and add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
3. In a separate large bowl, combine 2 cups (475 g) of flour, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Whisk together until well combined. Set aside.
4. Place the crushed Pringles in a shallow dish or pie plate.
5. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or deep frying pan over medium heat to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
6. Remove chicken pieces from buttermilk, letting any excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the seasoned flour mixture, then press into the Pringles, pressing firmly to adhere.
7. Carefully place coated chicken pieces into the hot oil and fry for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer chicken to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet or plate to drain.
8. Maintain the oil temperature at 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) and repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Serve warm.

## Notes

- For a spicier coating, increase the amount of cayenne pepper.
- This recipe can also be used for wings or drumsticks, but adjust cooking time accordingly.
