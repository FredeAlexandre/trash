 # Chicken Nuggets with Pomme Désireé, Chorizo and Mayonnaise Dip

## Ingredients

- 500g chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 3 cups panko breadcrumbs
- 1.5 l vegetable oil, for frying
- 4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt to taste
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 200g chorizo, sliced
- Mayonnaise, for serving

## Instructions

### Chicken Nuggets

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
3. Place flour in one shallow bowl, beaten eggs in another, and panko breadcrumbs in a third shallow bowl. Dredge each piece of chicken through the flour, then coat it with egg mixture and lastly roll it in the panko breadcrumbs. Set aside.
4. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until it reaches 180°C (350°F). Fry chicken nuggets in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

### Pomme Désireé

1. Preheat oven to 220°C (430°F).
2. Toss potatoes with olive oil in a large bowl. Season generously with salt. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast for about 45 minutes or until tender and golden brown, turning occasionally.

### Chorizo Dip

1. Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook chopped onion until softened, stirring occasionally, about 3-4 minutes.
2. Add sliced chorizo and cook for another 5 minutes, or until crispy.
3. Serve hot with mayonnaise as a dip.

## Notes

- You can prepare the chicken nuggets up to this point and refrigerate them for up to 1 hour before cooking.
- Pomme Désireé can be made using any type of potatoes, such as russet or Yukon gold.
