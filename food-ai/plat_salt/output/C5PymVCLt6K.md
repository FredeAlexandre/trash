 # Crimson Coward's Nashville Hot Chicken Recipe

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs (1.8 kg) chicken pieces
- 2 cups (473 ml) buttermilk
- 1 cup (236 ml) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (118 ml) cornstarch
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) garlic powder
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) onion powder
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) cayenne pepper
- 2 tbsp (30 g) salt
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) black pepper, freshly ground
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) white pepper
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) thyme, dried
- 1 tbsp (15 ml) oregano, dried
- 2 cups (473 ml) vegetable oil
- 1 cup (236 ml) hot sauce
- 1/2 cup (118 ml) apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup (118 ml) brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Marinate the chicken pieces in buttermilk for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator.
2. In a shallow bowl, mix together flour, cornstarch, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, white pepper, thyme, and oregano.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (176°C).
4. Coat each chicken piece with the flour mixture and place them into the hot oil. Fry for about 8 minutes, then remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
5. In a saucepan, combine hot sauce, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce thickens, around 10 minutes.
6. Brush each chicken piece with the hot sauce mixture and return to the skillet or Dutch oven with oil, frying for an additional 2-3 minutes.
7. Serve the hot chicken on buns with desired toppings, such as coleslaw or pickles.

## Notes

- Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper according to your preferred level of spiciness.
- For a crispier texture, you can double-dip the chicken pieces in the flour mixture before frying.
