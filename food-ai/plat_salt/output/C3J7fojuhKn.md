 # Orange Chicken and Chow Mein

## Ingredients

- 500g chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cups orange juice
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 8 oz chow mein noodles, cooked according to package instructions
- Sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine chicken with 1 cup cornstarch and let it rest for 30 minutes.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together orange juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and brown sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a simmer.
3. Heat oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, coated with remaining cornstarch, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add orange juice mixture and bring to a boil. Cook for a few minutes until thickened. Return chicken to the pan and stir to coat evenly.
5. Serve orange chicken over cooked chow mein noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired.

## Notes

- If you prefer a spicier orange chicken, add red pepper flakes or sriracha to taste.
- You can also add vegetables like bell peppers and carrots to the orange chicken for added texture and nutrition.
