 # Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowls

## Ingredients

- 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs (1 - 1+1/2 lbs.)
- 1 Cup Jasmine Rice
- 2 tsp Avocado Oil
- 1 Tbsp Cornstarch
- 1 tsp White Vinegar
- 2 Cups Broccoli Florets

## For the Sauce + Marinade:
- 2 Garlic Cloves, minced
- 2 tsp Fresh Ginger, minced
- 1 Cup Water
- 1/4 Cup Soy Sauce
- 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar

## Notes
- Vegan modification: Sub in firm tofu for chicken (cut in half to create two 1/2" thick rectangles, then drain it between two towels under something heavy for 30 mins to remove excess moisture, then marinate and pan fry)
- Salt for broccoli

## Instructions
1. Mix together the ingredients for the sauce + marinade (garlic, ginger, water, soy sauce, and brown sugar); reserve 1 cup for the teriyaki sauce and pour the rest in a bowl with the chicken; stir to coat the chicken evenly, cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 30 mins (up to 1 day)
2. Place the jasmine rice and 1+1/4 cups water in a small pot; bring to a simmer over medium high heat, then turn to low and cover and simmer for 12-15 mins until all liquid is absorbed; let stand for 5-10 mins then fluff with a fork
3. Preheat a pan (cast iron if you have it) over medium high and add 2 tsp oil, drip excess marinade off chicken and sear 5-6 mins per side (10-12 mins total) until chicken is charred and internal temp reaches 165F; place the chicken on a plate and let rest
4. In a separate small pot over medium heat, heat the remaining teriyaki sauce mixture for 1-2 mins until warm; mix 1 Tbsp cornstarch with 1 Tbsp water and whisk it into the sauce (this will thicken it); cook until the sauce bubbles and thickens (1-2 min) then turn off the heat and stir in the white vinegar
5. Add the chicken (along with any juices that have dripped onto the plate) to the pot with the sauce and toss to coat
6. Sprinkle a little salt on the broccoli and place it in a microwave safe bowl with 2 Tbsp water; cover and microwave 2-4 mins until bright green and tender
7. Slice the chicken and serve over warm rice with broccoli and teriyaki sauce drizzled on top - enjoy!
