 # Korean Fried Chicken Bites

## Ingredients

- Coating:
  - 5 chicken thighs
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp pepper
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp ginger powder
  - 1 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 3 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch

- Sauce:
  - 3 tbsp ketchup
  - 2 tbsp gochujang
  - 2 tbsp honey
  - 1 tsp sugar
  - 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tsp fresh ginger, minced
  - 1 tsp fresh garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Cut chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large bowl.
2. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, ginger powder, and vegetable oil. Mix well to coat evenly.
3. Add cornstarch or potato starch to the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Shake off excess starch.
4. Preheat air fryer to 200¬∞F (93¬∞C) for 15 minutes. Lightly oil the basket.
5. Add chicken bites to the basket, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Lightly spray oil on top of the chicken.
6. Air fry for 7-8 minutes, then flip and spray oil on top. Continue air frying for another 7 minutes or until crispy and cooked through.
7. In a pan, heat sauce ingredients at medium heat until combined and thickened. Set aside.
8. Once chicken is ready, toss it in the sauce and serve hot, garnished with sesame seeds and green onions.

## Notes

- For extra crispiness, you can double coat the chicken in cornstarch before air frying.
- Adjust the level of spiciness by using less or more gochujang.
