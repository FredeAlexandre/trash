 # Chicken and Crunchy Kipburgers Panbroodjes

## Ingredients

- 500g chicken mince
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 1 tbsp sriracha sauce
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 4 green onions, sliced
- 2 cups shredded cabbage
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 pack of crunchy kipburgers (store bought)
- 1 loaf of bread for panbroodjes

## Instructions

1. Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and cornstarch to make the sauce for the kipburgers. Set aside.
2. Cook chicken mince in the skillet until browned. Drain off excess fat. Add garlic and onion, cook until softened.
3. Stir in bell pepper and green onions. Cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften.
4. Pour sauce over the chicken mixture and stir until thickened.
5. Preheat oven as per instruction on the kipburger package. Cook according to instructions and set aside.
6. In another pan, heat up some oil for panbroodjes. Cut the bread into slices and press each slice into the raw chicken mixture, coating both sides.
7. Fry each side of the breaded bread until golden brown and crispy. Set aside on a paper towel lined plate.
8. Assemble the panbroodjes by placing a scoop of rice at the bottom, topping with a slice of panbroodje, kipburger, cabbage, and green onions. Repeat for each serving.

## Notes

- For spicier kipburgers, increase the amount of sriracha sauce.
- Use gluten free soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and rice vinegar for a gluten free version.
