 # Chicken Tenders with Honey Sriracha Sauce

## Ingredients

- 500g chicken tenders
- 250g fromage blanc
- 1 cup crème liquide
- 2 tbsp paprika
- 2 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp herbes de Provence
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp honey
- 3 tbsp Sriracha sauce
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a shallow dish, mix together paprika, garlic powder, herbes de Provence, and cumin. Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper. Coat chicken in the spice mixture.
3. In another shallow dish, beat eggs and set aside. In a third shallow dish, mix milk and crème liquide.
4. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip each coated chicken tender into the beaten egg mixture, then coat with milk mixture, allowing excess to drip off before adding it to the hot oil. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
5. Transfer chicken tenders to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes.
6. In a small saucepan, combine fromage blanc, Sriracha sauce, honey, and minced garlic. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and sauce is thickened.
7. Drizzle the cooked chicken tenders with the prepared honey sriracha sauce before serving. Garnish with parsley.

## Notes

- For a spicier sauce, add more Sriracha to taste.
- Serve these delicious tenders with your favorite dipping sauces or coleslaw.
