 # Creamy Garlic Herb Cajun Chicken Thighs

## Ingredients

- 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp Cajun seasoning
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-3 chillies, finely chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan
- 1 tbsp Cajun spices

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400째F (205째C).
2. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, Cajun seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Brush both sides of chicken thighs with the mixture.
3. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add chicken thighs in a single layer and cook for 4 minutes on each side until browned. Remove from skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add minced garlic and chopped chillies. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Stir in Cajun spices and cook for another 30 seconds.
6. Gradually pour heavy cream into the skillet, stirring constantly to prevent lumping.
7. Once the sauce has thickened, add grated Parmesan and continue cooking until melted and well combined with the sauce.
8. Place browned chicken thighs back in the skillet, spooning some of the sauce over them.
9. Bake for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (74째C).
10. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- Adjust the number of chillies according to your desired level of spiciness.
- For a dairy-free alternative, replace heavy cream with coconut milk or another non-dairy milk.
