 # Chicken Burger Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 Chicken breast
- 1 Garlic clove
- 1 tbsp Paprika
- 1 tbsp Garlic powder
- 1 tbsp Onion powder
- 1 tsp Black pepper
- Salt to taste
- Mustard for serving

## For the chicken patties:
- 1 cup Breadcrumbs
- 2 Eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup All-purpose flour

## Sauce
- 2 tbsp Mayonnaise
- 1 tsp Garlic, minced
- 1 tsp Parsley, finely chopped
- Few drops of Honey
- Water as needed

## Instructions
1. Prepare the chicken patties: Finely chop or mince the garlic. In a bowl, combine paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Rub this seasoning mix all over the chicken breast. Slice it into portions that will fit in your burger buns.
2. Form each chicken portion into a patty using your hands or a rolling pin. Set aside.
3. Prepare the breading: In three separate shallow dishes, place flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs. Coat each chicken patty first in flour, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and lastly coat it with breadcrumbs. Set aside on a plate.
4. Fry or air-fry the coated chicken patties until golden brown and cooked through (about 5 minutes per side for frying). For oven cooking, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake for about 20 minutes.
5. Prepare the sauce: In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, minced garlic, parsley, honey, and water to reach your desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
6. Assemble your burger by spreading some mustard on the bottom bun, followed by a fried chicken patty, a dollop of sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and the top bun.

## Notes
- You can add cheese to your chicken burger by inserting a slice between the chicken patty and the sauce or placing it on top of the cooked patty before serving.
- You can also grill or pan-fry the burger buns for added flavor.
