 # Honey Sriracha Shrimp Bowl

## Ingredients
- 200g shrimp, deveined and tails removed
- Cooked rice for serving
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Red pepper flakes

### For the Honey Sriracha Sauce:
- 3 tbsp honey

## Instructions
1. Prepare the Honey Sriracha Sauce by whisking together honey, soy sauce, Sriracha sauce, olive oil, and corn starch in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. Cook shrimp with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste in a pan over medium heat until pink and opaque. Remove from pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add a little more oil if necessary and heat up the Honey Sriracha Sauce, stirring constantly until it thickens and coats the shrimp evenly when added back to the pan.
4. Assemble the bowls: Divide rice among bowls, top with cooked shrimp, a scoop of edamame, sliced cucumber, green onions, and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro. Drizzle each bowl with the Honey Sriracha Sauce.

## Notes

- For a vegetarian option, replace shrimp with tofu or tempeh and adjust seasoning accordingly.
