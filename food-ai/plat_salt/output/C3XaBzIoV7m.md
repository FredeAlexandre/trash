 # Onigiri with Eggplant, Tuna and Avocado

## Ingredients

- 430g sushi rice
- 3 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 can tuna
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp sweet soy sauce
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 avocado
- 1/4 eggplant
- Fried onion

## Instructions

1. Cook sushi rice according to package instructions.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together rice vinegar, sugar and salt until dissolved.
3. Warm up cooked rice and spread it evenly onto a large plate. Drizzle the rice with the seasoned vinegar, spreading it evenly as well. Let it cool down.
4. Prepare tuna by draining the can and flaking it with a fork.
5. Cut avocado into slices and eggplant into small cubes.
6. Heat sesame oil in a pan and fry onion until crispy. Set aside.
7. In a bowl, mix together sweet soy sauce and mayonnaise.
8. Assemble onigiri: take a small amount of rice, shape it into an oblong form, then fill the center with tuna, avocado, or eggplant. Wrap the filling with more rice and shape it back into an oblong shape using wet hands to prevent sticking.
9. Dip each onigiri gently in the seasoned mayonnaise mixture before serving.
10. Garnish onigiri with fried onions.

## Notes

- You can use different fillings for onigiri, such as salmon or pickled plums.
- To make vegetarian onigiri, replace tuna with mashed tofu or cooked sweet corn.
