 # Sticky Honey Chilli AirFryer Chicken

## Ingredients

- 2 chicken breasts, cut into large chunks
- 5 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 egg, whisked
- 2 slices white bread, blitzed into breadcrumbs
- Spray oil

### For the sauce

- 4 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
- 2 tsp ketchup
- 2 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp soya sauce
- Juice half a lime
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 small onion, sliced
- 1 flat teaspoon cornflour
- 50-70ml water

## Instructions

1. Prepare the chicken: In a sealed bag, add the flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Add the chicken pieces and shake around to coat in flour. Set up the egg in a dish and the breadcrumbs in another. Dip each piece in the beaten egg then the breadcrumbs.
2. Preheat the AirFryer or oven: Preheat the AirFryer or oven to 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit). Place the chicken on a baking paper and spray all over with cooking oil. This is important to get a crispy crust to form.
   - If using an AirFryer, cook for approximately 10 minutes.
   - If cooking in the oven, cook for approximately 15 minutes but always check that the chicken is cooked through.
3. Prepare the sauce: In a small frying pan, add all ingredients except the water/cornflour. Let bubble for 2-3 minutes to soften the garlic and onion. Add 1 tbsp water to a dish and add the cornflour, mixing well. Add in the rest of the water to this dish, then add it to your pot. Let thicken for 2 minutes or so, then add in your chicken. Stir to coat in the sauce.
4. Serve: Serve with rice and vegetables and enjoy!

## Notes

- You can adjust the level of spiciness by adding more or less chilli sauce according to taste.
- If you don't have an AirFryer, you can cook the chicken in the oven. Cook for approximately 15 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit).
