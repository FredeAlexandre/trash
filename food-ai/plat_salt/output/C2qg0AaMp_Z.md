 # Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring just until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using).
5. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden brown around the edges. Cool on wire racks.

## Notes

- For best results, use room temperature ingredients and avoid overmixing the dough.
- You can also add raisins, dried cranberries, or other mix-ins of your choice instead of nuts.
