 # Chili-Sweet Gluten-Free Chicken Tenders

## Ingredients

- 3 chicken breasts, cut into 2-3 inch pieces
- Marinade:
  - 1/2 tsp chili powder
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp crushed red pepper
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
- 4 cups gluten-free corn flakes, crushed
- Coating:
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp crushed red pepper
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

2. In a small bowl, mix together marinade ingredients for the chicken: chili powder, smoked paprika, crushed red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Pat dry the chicken breasts and cut into 2-3 inch pieces. Toss with the marinade, cover, and let it rest for about 15 minutes.

3. Prepare the coating: In a large bowl, combine crushed gluten-free cornflakes, smoked paprika, crushed red pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Set aside.

4. Dip each marinated piece of chicken into the beaten eggs, then coat it in the cornflake mixture, making sure it's evenly covered. Place each piece on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Spray the chicken tenders with cooking oil.

5. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until cooked through and crispy on the outside.

## Instructions (Sauce)

1. In a saucepan, heat honey and barbecue sauce over medium heat, stirring occasionally until well combined.

## Notes

- For an extra spicy coating, increase the amount of crushed red pepper in both the marinade and coating.
- You can serve these delicious gluten-free chicken tenders with your favorite dips or BBQ sauce for added flavor.
