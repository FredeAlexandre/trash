 # Creamy Chicken Pasta

## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 12 oz pasta (penne or fusilli work well)
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 1/2 cups cooked chicken (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups vegetables of your choice (optional)

## Instructions

1. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain, reserving some cooking water for later use.

2. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions and cook until softened. Add garlic and cook for an additional minute.

3. Stir in flour, making a roux. Slowly pour in milk while continuously whisking to prevent lumps. Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it thickens (approximately 10 minutes).

4. Reduce heat to low and gradually add shredded cheese, stirring until fully melted. Add paprika, salt, and pepper. If needed, adjust consistency with reserved pasta water or additional milk.

5. Fold in cooked chicken and vegetables (optional) and remove from heat.

6. Combine the cheesy sauce with cooked pasta. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- For a spicier dish, add cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to taste.
- Cooked bacon or pancetta can be used instead of chicken for an added flavor.
