 # Spicy Gyoza Ramen

## Ingredients

- 1 pack of instant noodles
- 4 gyoza's (of your choice, I chose pork)
- 1 tbsp Kimchi
- Small pak choi, half
- 1x egg
- Chilli oil, for topping
- Sesame seeds, for topping

## Instructions

1. Cook the instant noodles as per the pack's instructions.
2. Boil the egg for 6 minutes, then add it to an ice bath to stop the cooking process and create a jammy egg.
3. Cook the gyoza's as per the pack's instructions (I steamed them using a bamboo steamer).
4. Cook the pak choi in a bamboo steamer.
5. Once the noodles are cooked, reserve the broth and add the noodles to a pan with chilli oil and soy sauce for added flavor.
6. Add the noodles to a bowl with the broth, and top with gyoza's, pak choi, jammy egg, kimchi, chilli oil, and sesame seeds - enjoy!

## Notes

- This bowl is what heaven is made of! Packed full of ingredients and flavor, and can take 10 minutes to make!
- For more flavor, you can add some garlic or ginger when cooking the pak choi.
- You can also adjust the spiciness level by adding more or less chilli oil.
