 # Sesame Chicken Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450g) chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/2 cup (125ml) cornstarch
- 1/2 cup (125ml) water
- 1/3 cup (80ml) soy sauce
- 1/3 cup (80ml) honey
- 1 tbsp (15ml) apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp (15ml) sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch (2.5cm) ginger, grated
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup (250ml) broccoli florets
- 6 green onions, sliced
- 1/4 cup (60g) sesame seeds, toasted

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water until smooth. Add chicken pieces and coat evenly.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp (15ml) of oil. Remove chicken from the cornstarch mixture, letting excess drip off, and cook in batches until browned on all sides. Set aside.
3. In a separate pan, heat 1 tbsp (15ml) of oil over medium heat. Saut√© garlic and ginger for 1 minute.
4. Whisk together soy sauce, honey, apple cider vinegar, sesame oil in a small bowl.
5. Add bell peppers and broccoli to the pan with garlic and ginger, cooking until tender-crisp.
6. Return chicken to the pan, along with green onions and sauce. Cook for 2 minutes or until heated through, stirring frequently.
7. Transfer to a serving dish, garnish with sesame seeds, and serve over rice.

## Notes

- For added spiciness, add red pepper flakes to the garlic and ginger while saut√©ing.
- To make this recipe gluten-free, use tamari sauce instead of soy sauce.
