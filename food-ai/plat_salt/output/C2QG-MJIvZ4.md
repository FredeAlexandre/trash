 # Honey Chicken

## Ingredients
- 2 egg whites
- 1/2 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 300g chicken breast, cut into 3cm cubes
- 50g cornflakes
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, for baking
- 3 tbsp runny honey
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tsp custard powder
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 15g ginger, grated

## To Serve:
- 250g cooked white rice
- Sesame seeds, to garnish

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a bowl, whisk together egg whites and white pepper until frothy. Set aside.
3. Crush cornflakes in a food processor or place them in a sealed plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin. Transfer the crushed cornflakes to a shallow dish.
4. Toss chicken cubes in sesame oil, then coat each piece with egg white mixture, followed by the cornflake crumbs. Shake off excess crumbs and transfer to the prepared baking tray. Repeat for all pieces of chicken.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.
6. In a small saucepan, heat sesame oil over medium heat. Add grated ginger and cook until fragrant. Stir in honey, water, rice wine vinegar, custard powder, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat.
7. In a separate pan, heat oil over medium heat. Sauté chicken cubes for a minute or two on each side. Transfer to serving plates.
8. Drizzle honey sauce over the cooked chicken and serve with cooked white rice and sesame seeds for garnish.
