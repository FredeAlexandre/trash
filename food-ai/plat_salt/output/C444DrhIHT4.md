 # Ramen Date Night

## Ingredients

- 4 servings ramen noodles
- 1 packet (3 oz) ramen seasoning mix
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 lb ground pork or chicken
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 cup sliced shiitake mushrooms
- 1 cup chopped cabbage
- 4 eggs
- Green onions, thinly sliced, for garnish
- Soy sauce or other preferred seasoning, to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook noodles according to package instructions and set aside.
2. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground pork (or chicken) and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat.
3. Add garlic and onion, cooking until softened.
4. Stir in mushrooms and cabbage; cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Crack eggs into pot around edges, stirring gently to set yolks while allowing whites to cook through.
6. Add cooked noodles to pot, followed by ramen seasoning packets. Stir gently to combine and heat through.
7. Serve hot in bowls, garnished with green onions and a splash of soy sauce (or preferred seasoning) to taste.

## Notes

- To make this vegetarian/vegan, omit the ground meat and add your preferred protein source or veggie alternative.
- For a spicier ramen, add red pepper flakes or chili oil.
- Customize your bowl with additional toppings like bean sprouts, bok choy, or sesame seeds.
