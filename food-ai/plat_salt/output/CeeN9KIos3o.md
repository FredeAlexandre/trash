 # Creamy Pizza Chicken Wraps

## Ingredients
- 120g Chicken Breast, raw
- 1 Flour Tortilla Wrap
- 40g Tomato Pizza Sauce
- 40g Light Cream Cheese
- 1/2 Pepperami, sliced
- 15g Mozzarella, grated
- 10g Reduced Fat Cheddar, grated
- 1/2 tbsp dried Oregano

## Instructions
1. Heat a pan with cooking spray over medium heat. Add chicken breast, season with salt and pepper, cook for 6-7 minutes until browned and fully cooked through.
2. In a bowl, combine cooked chicken, pizza sauce, cream cheese, oregano, pepperami, mozzarella, cheddar, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Lay the tortilla wrap flat, spread the chicken mixture across the middle. Fold up the wrap like a burrito.
4. Heat the same pan over medium heat with cooking spray. Cook the wrap for 5 minutes on each side until golden and crispy.

- Dice chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking.
- For easy folding, lay the wrap flat, spread the filling across the middle, and then fold up the sides like a burrito.
