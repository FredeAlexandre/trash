 # Soy Glazed Chicken Rice Bowls

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- 2 green onions, sliced
- 2 cups cooked white rice
- Sesame seeds and sliced green onions for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.
2. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Place in the hot skillet, skin side down, and cook for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Flip and cook through, about 4 minutes per side. Set aside on a plate.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, ginger, and sesame oil.
4. Heat the same skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tbsp of vegetable oil and garlic. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
5. Pour the soy glaze into the skillet and bring to a simmer.
6. Add the cooked chicken thighs back to the pan, turning them to coat evenly in the sauce.
7. Cook for 2 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.
8. Divide rice among bowls. Top with chicken, green onions, and sesame seeds if desired.
9. Drizzle with additional soy glaze as needed.

## Notes

- You can use other cuts of chicken for this recipe, such as bone-in or breast, but boneless thighs cook faster and give you that crispy skin.
- For a spicier version, add red pepper flakes to taste when making the soy glaze.

Feel free to use any other cuts of chicken (e.g., bone-in, breast, wings). Boneless thighs are my go-to since they just cook faster + you can‚Äôt miss out on the crispy chicken skin. The full recipe is live on the blog now (link in bio!) [iankewks.com/soy-glazed-chicken/]"
