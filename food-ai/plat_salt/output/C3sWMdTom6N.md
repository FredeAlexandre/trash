 # Butter Beef Crust Bacon 'n' Cheese Sauce Burger

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450 g) Signature super crust smashed dry-aged beef blend
- KL’s Secret butter cheese sauce
- KL’s butter mayonnaise
- Crispy maple candied smoked bacon
- Crunchy mini fries
- Double layered cheddar cheese
- Golden buttered toasted sesame brioche bun

## Instructions

1. Preheat grill or skillet to medium-high heat for the beef patties.
2. Form the ground beef into desired patty sizes, making sure not to overwork the meat.
3. Season both sides of each patty with your preferred burger seasoning.
4. Place the patties onto the grill or skillet and cook for about 4 minutes on each side or until they reach your desired doneness. Be careful not to press down on them as this will release juices and dry out the meat.
5. While the beef is cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients as follows:
   - Cook the crispy maple candied smoked bacon according to package instructions or until crispy and caramelized. Set aside.
   - Prepare the mini fries according to your favorite recipe or by purchasing pre-made ones. Set aside for serving.
   - Assemble the KL’s butter cheese sauce and butter mayonnaise as per the recipes below.
6. Once the beef patties are cooked, assemble the burgers as follows:
   - Place a patty on the bottom half of the toasted sesame brioche bun.
   - Spread a generous amount of KL’s butter cheese sauce on top of the patty.
   - Add a second patty and spread more sauce on its surface.
   - Top with a few slices of crispy maple candied smoked bacon.
   - Place double layered cheddar cheese on top of the bacon.
7. Spread a generous amount of KL’s butter mayonnaise on the top half of the toasted sesame brioche bun.
8. Carefully place the top half of the bun onto the assembled burger, pressing down gently so it sticks together.
9. Serve with crunchy mini fries and an additional dollop of KL’s butter cheese sauce or butter mayonnaise on the side for dipping.

## Notes

- For the best results, use a dry-aged beef blend to make your patties. This will enhance the flavor of your burger.
- Be sure not to overcook the bacon as it can become tough and chewy. Cook it until it's crispy yet still tender.
- To make the KL’s Secret butter cheese sauce, melt 1/2 cup (118 ml) unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once it has melted, remove from heat and whisk in 2 cups (473 ml) shredded cheddar cheese until fully combined. Stir in 1/2 cup (118 ml) mayonnaise and 1/4 cup (60 ml) ketchup. Add salt and pepper to taste.
- To make KL’s butter mayonnaise, whisk together 1 cup (237 ml) mayonnaise, 1/2 cup (118 ml) melted unsalted butter, 1 tbsp (15 ml) Dijon mustard, and 1 tbsp (15 ml) honey. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
