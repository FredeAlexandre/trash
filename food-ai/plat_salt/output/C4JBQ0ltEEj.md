 # High Protein Teriyaki Chicken Fried Rice

## Ingredients

- 800g chicken breast
- tsp salt
- tsp pepper
- tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 60ml soy sauce (I used reduced salt)
- 10ml of mirin (or rice wine vinegar)
- tsp ginger paste
- tsp garlic paste
- 3 tbsp honey
- tbsp sesame seeds
- tsp cornflour mixed with a tbsp water
- 600g day-old cooked white rice (cook night before or chill for at least an hour before using)
- oyster sauce (or fish sauce)
- white parts of the spring onions
- tsp toasted sesame oil
- green parts of spring onion
- additional sesame seeds (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the chicken: Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cornstarch. Cook on medium-high heat with cooking spray till crispy and tender. Set aside.
2. Make the Teriyaki Glaze: In a saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, ginger paste, garlic paste, honey, and sesame seeds. Bring to a gentle simmer. Add cornflour mixture and cook until thickened. Set aside.
3. Prepare the Fluffy Fried Rice: In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Sauté white parts of spring onions. Add day-old cooked rice and soy sauce, oyster sauce (or fish sauce), and toasted sesame oil. Mix well and cook until heated through.
4. Assemble the dish: Combine crispy chicken with teriyaki glaze and fluffy fried rice in a serving bowl. Garnish with green parts of spring onions and additional sesame seeds, if desired.

## Notes

- For best results, use day-old cooked rice as it will not become mushy when stir-fried.
- Store for up to 5 days in the fridge. To reheat, microwave for 3 minutes partially covered and enjoy!
