- Texas toast bread
- Flank steak, sliced thinly
- Salt and pepper
- Butter
- Sautéed onions
- Sautéed bell peppers

## Instructions

1. Season the flank steak with salt and pepper, then grill or pan-fry until desired doneness. Set aside to rest.
2. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions, bell peppers, and garlic, cooking until softened.
3. In a small bowl, combine Worcestershire sauce and mayonnaise for the sandwich spread.
4. Toast Texas toast bread in a pan with additional butter.
5. Assemble the sandwich: spread mayo-Worcestershire sauce on one side of both slices of toast, place grilled steak, sautéed vegetables, pickles, and top slice of toast.

## Notes

- For a spicier sandwich, add hot sauce or jalapeños to the sautéed vegetables.
- Swap out pickles for sliced tomatoes or avocado for added texture and flavor.
