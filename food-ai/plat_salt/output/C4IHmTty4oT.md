 # Cucumber Sushi by Natasha Swingler

## Ingredients

- Rice (2 cups)
- Sushi vinegar (1/4 cup)
- Water (2 cups)
- Nori sheets (4)
- Cucumber (1)
- Salt (for seasoning cucumber)

## Instructions

1. Prepare sushi rice: Rinse 2 cups of rice in cold water and drain. Cook rice with 2 cups of water according to package instructions. Once cooked, transfer rice to a large bowl and let it cool slightly. Mix in 1/4 cup of sushi vinegar and let sit for 30 minutes.

2. Prepare cucumber: Slice the cucumber into thin rounds using a mandoline or sharp knife. Lightly sprinkle salt on both sides of the cucumber slices, then let it sit for about 10 minutes to extract moisture. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.

3. Assemble sushi: Lay out a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat or a large piece of plastic wrap. Wet hands slightly with water to prevent sticking, then spread about 1 cup of rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.

4. Place cucumber slices vertically along the rice, spacing them about an inch apart.

5. Lift the edge of the mat or plastic wrap closest to you and gently roll the sushi into a cylinder shape, using gentle pressure as you go. Continue rolling until the entire sheet is rolled up. Set aside and repeat with remaining nori sheets, rice, and cucumber slices.

6. Cut each roll into 8 pieces using a sharp knife. Serve immediately or refrigerate for later.

## Notes

- To make this recipe vegan, use vegetarian sushi vinegar.
- For extra flavor, add sesame seeds or pickled ginger to the rice before assembling the rolls.
