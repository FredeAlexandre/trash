 # Long Cheeseburgers with Sauce and Veggies

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
- 4 hamburger buns, split
- 4 slices cheddar cheese
- Romaine lettuce leaves
- Sliced tomatoes
- Pickle spears
- Ketchup and mustard

## Instructions

1. Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Cook onion in the skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, stirring and breaking up with a spoon until browned and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Drain any excess fat.
3. Toast hamburger buns under the broiler or grill if desired.
4. Place a cooked patty on each bottom bun half. Top with a slice of cheddar cheese.
5. Assemble the burgers with lettuce leaves, tomato slices, pickle spears, and ketchup and mustard as desired.
6. Top with the other half of the bun.

## Notes

- For extra flavor, add garlic powder or onion powder to the ground beef mixture while cooking.
- These burgers can be made gluten-free by using lettuce wraps instead of buns.
