## Instructions

5. Crush the cornflakes into small pieces in a food processor or in a ziplock bag using a rolling pin. Place them in a third shallow dish.

3. Pour this sauce over the cooked chicken tenders before serving.

## Notes

- For an extra kick of heat, increase the amount of cayenne pepper or hot sauce used in the recipe.
- This dish pairs well with steamed vegetables or a side salad for a complete meal.
