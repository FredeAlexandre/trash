 # Chicken and Waffles Panbroodjes (Mini Chicken Burgers in Waffles)

## Ingredients

- 500g ground chicken
- 1 egg, beaten
- 2 slices of white bread, torn into small pieces
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 300g waffle batter (store-bought or homemade)
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix ground chicken, beaten egg, torn bread pieces, chopped onion, minced garlic, soy sauce, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, honey, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper until evenly combined.
2. Form the mixture into small patties using your hands or a cookie scoop. Set aside on a plate.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken burgers for about 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels.
4. Prepare waffle batter according to the package instructions or your preferred recipe.
5. Heat a preheated waffle iron. Brush it with oil or cooking spray if needed. Place a chicken burger patty onto the waffle iron, then pour enough waffle batter over the top to cover the burger completely. Cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.
6. Serve the Chicken and Waffles Panbroodjes hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- Adjust the seasoning to your preference.
- For a sweeter version, use a sweet waffle batter instead of savory.
