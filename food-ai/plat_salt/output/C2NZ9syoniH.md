## Instructions
1. Cut the chicken up into strips and coat each one in flour.
2. Mix the breadcrumbs with smoked paprika and some salt and pepper.
3. Coat the chicken in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Repeat this step to get your chicken extra crispy.
4. Add the chicken to the air fryer, drizzle with oil and then cook for 15 minutes at 190 degrees Celsius, turning halfway through.
5. To a pan, add sweet chilli sauce, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. Mix together and then heat on low for 10 minutes until it starts to bubble.
6. Once the chicken is cooked, add it to the sauce and turn until all the chicken is coated.
7. Add a drizzle of mayo to each wrap and split the lettuce and chicken between them.
8. Wrap up, slice in half, and serve immediately.

## Notes
- For an added crunch, you can also add shredded cabbage or carrots to the wraps.
- You can adjust the spiciness of the sweet chili sauce to your preference by using more or less depending on your taste.
