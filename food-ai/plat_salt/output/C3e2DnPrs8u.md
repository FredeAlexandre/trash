 # Chick'N Fries Burger Recipe

## Ingredients

- 4 chicken breasts, sliced into strips
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- Salt to taste
- French fries for serving

## Instructions

1. In a shallow dish, marinate the chicken strips in buttermilk for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C).
3. In another shallow dish, combine flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Coat each chicken strip in the flour mixture.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated chicken until golden brown, approximately 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
5. Transfer fried chicken to a baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for an additional 10 minutes.
6. Prepare French fries according to your preferred method (oven or deep-fried).
7. Serve Chick'N Fries with your favorite dipping sauce.

## Notes

- You can add some hot sauce to the buttermilk marinade for a spicier Chick'N Fries.
- For a low-carb option, serve the chicken strips over a bed of lettuce or roasted vegetables instead of French fries.
