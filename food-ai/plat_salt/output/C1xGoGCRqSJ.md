 # Easy Fried Chicken Tenders

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450g) chicken tenderloins or breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cups (475ml) buttermilk
- 3 cups (720g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp salt
- 3 cups (720ml) vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375째F (190째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the buttermilk and chicken pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
3. In a separate large bowl, combine flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt. Whisk until evenly mixed.
4. Remove chicken from the buttermilk, letting excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure they are fully coated. Place on a clean plate or tray.
5. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it reaches 325째F (165째C). Carefully place chicken pieces into the hot oil and fry for 5-6 minutes or until golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken from oil and transfer to prepared baking sheet.
6. Once all pieces have been fried, place baking sheet in preheated oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
7. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.

## Notes

- For a spicier version, increase the amount of cayenne pepper.
- You can also make this recipe using store-bought buttermilk ranch dressing instead of buttermilk for an extra flavorful coating.
