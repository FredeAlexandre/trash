 # Cheesy Honey BBQ Chicken & Crispy Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 900g peeled & diced potatoes (Spud Lite Potatoes)
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 tsp garlic powder, oregano, smoked paprika, and salt
- 900g diced chicken breast (raw weight)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt
- 4 diced garlic cloves
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 90g BBQ sauce
- 1 tbsp honey
- 100g light/low fat cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F).
2. Toss potatoes with olive oil and seasoning in a large bowl. Spread evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until crispy and golden brown.
3. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add chicken and garlic. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink. Season with spices.
4. In a small bowl, mix BBQ sauce and honey together.
5. Once the chicken is cooked through, add the BBQ sauce mixture to the pan. Stir well to coat evenly.
6. Transfer chicken and sauce to a baking dish. Top with cheese.
7. Place the baking dish under the oven broiler until the cheese has melted. (Alternatively, melt the cheese in a skillet by baking it in the oven for 3-5 minutes or until melted.)
8. Serve the chicken and potatoes together.

## Notes

- When melting the cheese, if using a skillet, bake it in the oven for 3-5 minutes or until melted; if using a regular cooking pan, place it back on the stove with a lid on top until the cheese has melted.
- Any potatoes can be used instead of Spud Lite Potatoes (Carisma), such as russet, sweet potatoes, etc.
