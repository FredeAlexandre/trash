 # Teriyaki Chicken Skewers

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (500g) chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup (240ml) teriyaki sauce
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced

## Instructions

1. Thread chicken pieces, bell peppers, onion, pineapple, and asparagus onto the skewers.
2. Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (205°C).
3. Brush teriyaki sauce over all sides of the skewers.
4. Place the skewers in the air fryer basket and cook for 12 minutes, flipping halfway through.
