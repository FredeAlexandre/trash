 # Strawberry Mogu Mogu with Yakult

## Ingredients

- 1 cup fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar (optional)
- 1 cup ice cubes
- 1 packet Yakult Original or Light
- Water (as needed)

## Instructions

1. In a blender, combine the sliced strawberries and sugar (if using). Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Taste and add more sugar if desired.
2. Add ice cubes to the blender and blend until the ice is crushed and the mixture has a thick, slushy consistency.
3. Pour the strawberry mixture into a tall glass.
4. Open the packet of Yakult and pour it over the strawberry ice.
5. Fill the rest of the glass with water, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top for stirring.
6. Stir the drink gently with a long-handled spoon to combine the Yakult and strawberry mixture.
7. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- If you prefer your Mogu Mogu less sweet, you can omit the sugar altogether.
- You can also add other fruits to the blender for a different flavor twist!
