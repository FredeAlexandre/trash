 # Cherry Peach Slushie

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup peach nectar juice
- Crushed ice
- 50ml cherry lime sparkling water

## Instructions

1. Fill a blender with crushed ice.
2. Pour in 1/3 cup of peach nectar juice.
3. Blend the mixture until it has reached a slushie consistency.
4. Pour in 50ml of cherry lime sparkling water.

## Notes

- For an extra sweet touch, add a few drops of grenadine syrup before blending the ice and juice.
- You can also use fresh or frozen peaches instead of peach nectar for a more natural and textured slushie.
