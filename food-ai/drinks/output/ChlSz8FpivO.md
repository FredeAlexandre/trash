   - Add 1 cup of fresh or frozen strawberries and muddle or masher them with a spoon or muddler to release their flavors.

3. Add the strawberry simple syrup to the lemonade base.
4. Gently muddle a few fresh basil leaves and add them to the pitcher or jar.
5. Refrigerate the mixture for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld together.

## Instructions (continued)

6. Taste the lemonade and add more sugar, if desired, before serving.
7. Fill glasses with ice and pour the strawberry basil lemonade over it.
8. Garnish each glass with a fresh strawberry slice and a sprig of basil for an elegant presentation.

## Notes
